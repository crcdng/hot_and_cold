# hot_and_cold

Contribution to the [Flame Game Jam 3.0](https://itch.io/jam/flame-jam-3)

## Limitations

1. The game/prototype has to be developed in the [Flame game engine](https://flame-engine.org/).

2. The game jam runs for a weekend, all work has to be done in that timeframe.

3. The theme is "Hot and Cold" and the chosen restriction is to use one button only (alternatives would be "no text" and "multiple endings"). 
 
## Devlog

### Friday 7pm 
- the theme and restrictions are revealed 

- grappling with a few ideas, doing research, theme / restriction point to endless runner (https://flappybird.io/, https://canabalt.com/). There are endless runner tutorials, templates and examples available (https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/examples/games/trex, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.fireslime.gravitational_waves, https://github.com/flutter/games/tree/main/templates/endless_runner, https://medium.com/flutter/how-we-built-the-new-super-dash-demo-in-flutter-and-flame-in-just-six-weeks-9c7aa2a5ad31)

- plan is to use free assets from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) and do audio myself if time permits

### Friday 11pm

- reading code, setting up the project. I don't have a lot experience with Flame. First tasks will be get the assets into the engine and get the basic logic running
