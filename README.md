# hot_and_cold

Archived game jam code, new versions available at: https://crcdng.itch.io/hot-and-cold 


Contribution to the [Flame Game Jam 3.0](https://itch.io/jam/flame-jam-3)

## Limitations

1. The game/prototype has to be developed in the [Flame game engine](https://flame-engine.org/).

2. The game jam runs for a weekend, all work has to be done in that timeframe.

3. The theme is "Hot & Cold" and the chosen restriction is to use a single button for input (alternatives would be "no text" and "multiple endings").

## Devlog

### Friday 7pm 

- theme and limitations are revealed 

- grappling with a few ideas, doing research, theme / restriction point to endless runner (https://flappybird.io/, https://canabalt.com/). There are endless runner tutorials, templates and examples available (https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/examples/games/trex, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.fireslime.gravitational_waves, https://github.com/flutter/games/tree/main/templates/endless_runner, https://medium.com/flutter/how-we-built-the-new-super-dash-demo-in-flutter-and-flame-in-just-six-weeks-9c7aa2a5ad31)

- plan is to use free assets from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) and do audio myself if time permits

### Friday 11pm

- reading code, setting up the project. First tasks will be to get the assets into the engine and kick off some basic logic (running). The key mechanism should be cold (blue) and hot (red) tiles and the player has to switch to ho or cold in order to survive. The parcours should be procedurally generated (no preconprepared map).
